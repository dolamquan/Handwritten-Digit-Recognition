Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset

This project is a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to train a neural network that can classify the digits and OpenCV to load and process the images for prediction.

Overview

The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a deep neural network. The project involves training the model and then testing it on user-provided images of handwritten digits. The trained model can predict digits from new images using OpenCV for image loading and preprocessing.#
